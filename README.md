## ðŸ“£ News
- [2024/06/11]:âœ¨The paper of [RWKV-CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06973) is submitted to arXiv.
  
## ðŸ’¡ Introduction
We introduce a diverse description generation framework that can leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to synthesize and refine content from web-based texts, synthetic captions, and detection tags. Beneficial form detection tags, more semantic information can be introduced from images, which in turn further constrains LLMs and mitigates hallucinations.

We propose RWKV-CLIP, the first RWKV-driven vision-language representation learning model that combines the effective parallel training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs.

## ðŸŽ¨ In-Progress
- [ ] Release training code
- [ ] Release pretrain model weight
- [ ] Release the generated diverse descriptions of YFCC15M
